> Ideally should be installed with docker.

But non-docker users can run the program using the following commands. 

If on Windows first install ruby and ruby gems.
May refer to this <a href= "https://youtu.be/LfP7Y9Ja6Qc"> Tutorial </a>

```
ruby -v
gem -v
```

Run the following commands after the previous two commands successfully outputs the version without any error.
### Install Jekyll

```
