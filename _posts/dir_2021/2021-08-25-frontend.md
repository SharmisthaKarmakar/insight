### What language does a front-end web developer use?

Frontend web developers use three programming languages for building up their websites live and interactive:-

1. **HTML**

1. **CSS**

3. **Javascript**

**HTML(Hypertext Markup Language):-** It is the *skeleton or backbone of any website* without this a web page can not exist. A markup language specifies that the text can be turned into images, links, videos, tables, etc. The HTML code gives a basic idea of how the website will look like.

**CSS(Cascading Style Sheets):-** It is the flesh of our web page and *adds beauty and uniqueness to our website*. It does this by maintaining style sheets that sit on top of other style rules and are triggered based on other inputs. CSS is the simple mechanism for adding different styles to your website (color, font styling, spacing).


**JavaScript:-** It is the **brain of our website and it lets us add a ton more functionality to our website and make it live**. Many websites use javascript(JS) to make their user interface easy and smooth (avoids reloading whenever the user pins to another page). Some JS frameworks give a ready-made structure for our javascript code, some of the most famous and commonly used JS frameworks are  AngularJS, Backbone, Ember, and ReactJS.

### Front end Frameworks 

Also referred to as CSS frameworks these are *pre-written, standardized codes in files*.

- It has got a **pre-built navbar, footer, carousel**, and many other components that are required in a website.

- Frameworks help in making our **site responsive/mobile-first-sites by itself and no media query codes** are required to be written.

- Instead of spending hours writing your code only to find out that it doesn't work, you will get already tested code that works for sure.

Since writing thousands of lines of CSS gets hectic and may take a lot longer to launch your website so in that case, you can use Frameworks.

Examples of front end frameworks:-

**Bootstrap:** It is the world's most popular and easy-to-use framework. It has got a lot of documents and examples which is very useful for a beginner level developer. 

**Foundation:** It helps in making beautiful responsive website designs. It is completely customizable as per the user's need. They are constantly adding new codes and designs to make your web pages interactive.

### Javascript Frameworks


JS has many different types of frameworks out of which the most popular ones are mentioned here. These **frameworks speed up your development** and can be used with JS libraries like jQuery which will reduce your work on writing tons of code.

**React**:  It is an open-source front-end Javascript library. It was created by a team of Facebook developers and was firstly tested on Facebook's newsfeed. **React.js is braced by the majority of the developer community** and it brought interactive user interfaces mainly single-page web applications which are being used by most apps and websites.

**Vue**: It is simple, unhindered, and accelerating in nature which adapts to the developer's needs. Vue has gained popularity in the last 2 years and is being used by some of the world's largest **companies like Adobe, Apple, BMW, Louis Vuitton**, etc.

**Angular**: It is an open-source typescript framework created by Google Engineers. Inspiration to make Angular.js was taken from React and it is the most stable and secure JS framework. It is being used by millions of websites including Google, Microsoft, IBM, etc.

It is very important to note that these frameworks should be treated as a last resort. In the first place, you should get familiar with HTML & CSS, then later on you can use these frameworks as an alternative and focus more on functionality. *Frameworks shall be treated as one's adjutant, not a walking stick.*  

### Responsive/Mobile Design

The majority of people access websites from their *tablets, mobile phones, rather than using laptops or PCs* so it's really important for your website to be responsive so that the users get to see an appropriate view of what your web page contains. 

### GIT 

So to begin as a developer you should have a basic idea about GitHub 

- Git is a free and open-source version control system. **It is one of the most widely used version control management systems**.


- It helps to keep a record of all the changes that you have made in a project. It is designed to handle both major and minor projects.

- By using GIT you can create different versions of your project and in case you want to jump back to your older versions you can easily do it using GIT.
